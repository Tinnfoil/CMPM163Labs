The first cube on the top was made by mixing two colors smoothly with the frag shader.
The second on the top was made with mixing two colors discretely twice. The image is made up four color parameters, but multiplied in a way were they mixed concretely.

Questions:

a. floor (u * 8)

b. floor (v * 8)

c. White, (floor(.375 * 8),floor(.25 * 8)) = (3,2) -> White

I made the three middle cube doing the same thing instructed in the tutorial. Adding a texture using three's in built texture loader. For the right cube, I loaded it in using the shaders from the pervious lab as a template. Because of this, it isn't effected by the lights in the scene. The left cube is implemented using the in-script method for shaders. I also made the 2x2 grid for the texture by multiplying the uVu by 2 but keeping it in the ranges of 0-1. Only coming back to 1 once it passes the 0.5 mark.
